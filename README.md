## Introduction

In the evolving landscape of fintech, access to real-time stock market data, coupled with analytical tools, is indispensable for both novice and experienced investors. This project encapsulates a web-based application designed to demystify stock market analysis through real-time data visualization, detailed stock insights, and comparative analysis of multiple stocks. Built with Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, the application leverages the yfinance library for fetching stock data, pandas for data manipulation, and Plotly for rendering interactive, insightful charts. This document outlines the application's backend logic, front-end design, and user interaction flow in detail.

## Backend Functionality Flask Application Setup

The backbone of our application, app.py, orchestrates routing, data processing, and view rendering. Flask's minimalist yet powerful structure allows for straightforward endpoint definition, enabling our application to respond to user requests with efficiency and precision.

### Data Fetching and Analysis

# Basic Stock Trading Strategy Program  [code](https://github.com/deadsmash07/Advance-Analytic-Tool/tree/main/Trading_Algorithms)

## 1.1 Basic Strategy Overview
This program implements a basic stock trading strategy based on the momentum of stock prices over the past `n` days. The algorithm operates as follows:
- **Buy**: If the stock price has been monotonically increasing for the last `n` days, the program buys one share.
- **Sell**: If the stock price has been monotonically decreasing for the last `n` days, it sells one share.

## Constraints and Assumptions
- **Short Selling**: The program assumes the ability to short-sell stocks.
- **Position Limits**: The maximum and minimum positions are `+x` and `-x` respectively, ensuring the position always stays within this range.
- **Data Preparation**: The program requires past `n` days of data even for the start date. This data must be pre-written to the file.
- **Parameters**:
    - `n`: Number of past days to consider for momentum calculation.
    - `x`: Maximum position allowed.

## Intuition Behind the Strategy
The strategy is based on the expectation that a continuous increase in price over the last `n` days indicates a further increase, prompting a buy action. Conversely, a continuous decrease suggests a future decline, leading to a sell action.

## Implementation Details

- **Key Methods**:
    - `buy()`: Executes a buy action.
    - `sell()`: Executes a sell action.
    - `readFromFile()`: Reads stock data from a file.

### Main Functionality
- **File Reading**: Reads stock data from a specified file.
- **Trading Logic**: Implements the buy/sell strategy based on price momentum.
- **Output**:
    - "order_statistics.csv": Contains order details.
    - "daily_cashflow.csv": Records daily cash flow.

### Auxiliary Functions

#  Report: Implementation of Trend-based Strategy using n-Day Moving Average (DMA)

## Introduction

In this project, we extend the basic stock trading strategy by incorporating a trend-based strategy using the n-Day Moving Average (DMA). This approach involves calculating the mean price of the past `n` days, along with the standard deviation, to make informed trading decisions.

## Implementation

### Class Design: `StockData`
- **Purpose**: Represents individual stock data, including date, price, and calculated DMA.
- **Key Features**:
    - `buy()` and `sell()` methods to record trading actions.
    - `setdma()` to update DMA for each stock data instance.
    - Additional methods for data management and retrieval.

### File Reading
- Implemented in `readFromFile()` method.
- Reads stock data from a CSV file and stores it in a vector of `StockData` objects.

### DMA Calculation
- For each data point, calculates the mean (DMA) and standard deviation of the past `n` days' prices.
- These calculations are pivotal for the decision-making process in the trading strategy.

### Trading Logic
- **Buying Criterion**: If the current price is greater than DMA by ≥ `p` standard deviations, buy one share.
- **Selling Criterion**: If the current price is less than DMA by ≥ `p` standard deviations, sell one share.
- **Position Constraints**: Ensures the position always stays within the range [-x, +x].

### Output Generation

## Parameters
- `n`: Number of days for calculating the DMA.
- `x`: Maximum position allowed.
- `p`: Standard deviation threshold for decision making.

# Lab Report: Implementation of Mean-Reverting Pairs Trading Strategy

## Overview

This project involves implementing a Mean-Reverting Pairs Trading Strategy using C++. The strategy is based on the price spread of a pair of correlated stocks, rather than on a single stock. We assume pre-tested correlation/cointegration between the stocks.

- **Spreadt = PS1,t - PS2,t**: The spread between the prices of the two stocks is calculated for each day.

### Rolling Mean and Standard Deviation

- For each day `t`, the mean and standard deviation of the spread over the past `n` days are calculated, including the current day.

### Z-Score Calculation

- **Z-Score**: `(Spread - Rolling Mean) / Rolling Std Dev`
- This score measures the deviation of the current spread from its historical average, normalized by the standard deviation.

### Trading Decisions

- **Sell Signal**: If `z_score > threshold`, indicating the spread is significantly higher than its historical average.
- **Buy Signal**: If `z_score < -threshold`, suggesting the spread is much lower than usual.

- The stocks are assumed to be correlated or cointegrated, as pre-tested.

## Execution

The strategy is executed using the command:
